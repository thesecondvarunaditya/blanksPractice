# Blanks Practice

Blanks is an archive of **iGCSE Fill-in-the-blank questions**

Using nothing but static HTML sites, this is a compilation of **Fill-in-the-blanks practice questions**</br>
generated through my PDF to Fill-in-the-blanks creator. The SaveMyExams PDFs that the</br>
questions are built from are included in the site
